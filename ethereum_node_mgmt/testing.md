# Testing

The role ships with a set of test scenarios implemented in Ansible Molecule. There's a test scenario for each supported task and client. You can use Molecule to quickly test the role. Molecule uses the same setup  as slingnode.ethereum role. Refer to the [documentation](http://localhost:5000/s/Ib9tX0kORM9rMi1DWQvF/testing) for details on the test implementation.&#x20;
